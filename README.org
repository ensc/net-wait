* Purpose

net-wait waits for network links or addresses to stabilize.  It can
also issue router solicitation messages (ICMPv6 type 133, RFC 4861)
when link comes up to speed up creation of SLAAC addresses (RFC 4862)

The 'ip link' and 'ip addr' can bring links up and add addresses on
them.  But it can take some time until they are usuable.

E.g. 'ip link up' waits until the physical link is up which can take
several seconds.  Or 'ip link add' puts IPv6 addresses into tentiative
state.
